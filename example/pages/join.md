# Getting Started with MeshCore

MeshCore is an open-source off-grid LoRa mesh networking platform. This guide will help you get connected to the network.

For detailed documentation, see the [MeshCore FAQ](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore/blob/main/docs/faq.md).

## Node Types

MeshCore devices operate in different modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Companion** | Connects to your phone via Bluetooth. Use this for messaging and interacting with the network. |
| **Repeater** | Standalone node that extends network coverage. Place these in elevated locations for best results. |
| **Room Server** | Hosts chat rooms that persist messages for offline users. |

Most users start with a **Companion** node paired to their phone.

## Frequency Regulations

MeshCore uses LoRa radio, which operates on unlicensed ISM bands. You **must** use the correct frequency for your region:

| Region | Frequency | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Europe (EU) | 868 MHz | EU868 band |
| United Kingdom | 868 MHz | Same as EU |
| North America | 915 MHz | US915 band |
| Australia | 915 MHz | AU915 band |

Using the wrong frequency is illegal and may cause interference. Check your local regulations.

## Compatible Hardware

MeshCore runs on ESP32-based LoRa devices. Popular options include:
